# Reactive Programming



## Summary

* Based on my experience, Subject seems to be the only useful feature in Reactive Programming.
* Reactive Programming is known to be 100 times slower than normal event-delegate so it can be used to multi-cast non realtime, historical messages. But it doesn't seem to have any use beyond that.
